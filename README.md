# dn
**D**ocker powered **N**ode.js version manager

## Getting started
- Clone this repo
- Invoke `./dn.sh -h` to get started.

## Limitations
Currently limited to whatever comes with `node:X-alpine` docker image. So, if you have a fancy build process which requires special dependencies then this manager cannot support it yet.
